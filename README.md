# soundboard.cool

This is the source code for a soundboard, soon to be entered into the Idle Thumbs Wizard Jam (2016). It has multiple soundboard support, custom css animations for some audio tracks, and the ability to loop audio. Although it is pretty bespoke, you should be able to only change the data.js file, css, images and audio files, to make it work for your purpose.

Make sure to checkout the gh-pages branch to see how it is used in action.
